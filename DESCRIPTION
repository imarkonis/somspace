Description: Application of the Self-Organizing Maps technique for spatial classification of time series. The package uses spatial data, point or gridded, to create clusters with similar characteristics. The clusters can be further refined to a smaller number of regions by hierarchical clustering and their spatial dependencies can be presented as complex networks. Thus, meaningful maps can be created, representing the regional heterogeneity of a single variable. More information and an example of implementation can be found in Markonis and Strnad (2019).
